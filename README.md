# AryaAPI [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/genius-lyrics-api.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/AryaAPI)

A JavaScript package that leverages [Genius API](https://genius.com/developers) to search and fetch song lyrics and album art.<br/>It doesn't use any native node dependencies and therefore, can be used on the client-side.

## Installation

```js
npm install --save AryaAPI
```

Or install with Yarn

```js
yarn add AryaAPI
```

## Usage

[Get the Genius Developer Access Token](https://genius.com/developers)
<br>

```js
import { GetLyrics, GetSong } from 'AryaAPI';
```

```js
const options = {
	apiKey: '7251827XXXXXX',
	title: 'Alone',
	artist: 'Alan Walker',
	optimizeQuery: true
};

getLyrics(options).then((lyrics) => console.log(lyrics));

getSong(options).then((song) =>
	console.log(`

	${song.title}
	${song.url}
	${song.albumArt}
	${song.lyrics}`)

## Types

```
type options {
	title: string;
	artist: string;
	apiKey: string;		// Genius developer access token
	optimizeQuery?: boolean; // Setting this to true will optimize the query for best results
	authHeader?: boolean; // Whether to include auth header in the search request. 'false' by default.
}

```

ðŸš¨ All properties in the options object are required except `optimizeQuery` and `authHeader`. If `title` or `artist` is unknown, pass an empty string.

```
type song {
	id: number;		// Genius song id
	title: string;          // Song title
	url: string;		// Genius webpage URL for the song
	lyrics: string;		// Song lyrics
	albumArt: string;	// URL of the album art image (jpg/png)
}

```

```
type SearchResult {
	id: number;		// Genius song id
	url: string;		// Genius webpage URL for the song
	title: string;		// Song title
	albumArt: string;	// URL of the album art image (jpg/png)
}
```
